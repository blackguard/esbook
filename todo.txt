make facet scripts inline-able without having been loaded via facet() [need to have one single export handler that listens for any facet export or error event]
call cleanup on change objects that are deleted
deleting element with an eval worker running something like setInterval(): old eval worker keeps running even though "stopped"

* don't load scripts more that once: load_script(), load_script_and_wait_for_condition()
